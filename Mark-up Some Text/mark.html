    <h1> Grace Hopper </h1>
    
    <h2> Summary </h2>
      <p class="summary"> <strong>Grace Murray Hopper</strong> was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. A pioneer in the field, she was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, and invented the first compiler for a computer programming language. She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, one of the first modern programming languages.</p>

    <h2> Biography </h2>
      <p class="biography">Grace Hopper was born in 1906 and went on to earn a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale University and was a professor of mathematics at Vassar College. In 1949, she joined the Eckertâ€“Mauchly Computer Corporation and was part of the team that developed the UNIVAC I computer. She believed that a programming language based on English was possible. She created one of the first 'linkers' which converted English terms into the machine code understood by computers.
     <br>
     <br>
     In the spring of 1959, a two-day conference known as the Conference on Data Systems Languages (CODASYL) brought together computer experts from industry and government. Hopper served as the technical consultant to the committee, and many of her former employees served on the short-term committee that defined the new language COBOL.
    <br>
    <br> 
    Throughout her years in academia and industry, Hopper was a consultant and lecturer for the United States Naval Reserve.
    <br>
    <br>
     She died on January 1, 1992 (aged 85) and on November 22, 2016, she was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.</p>

    <h2> Anecdotes </h2>
      <ul class="anecdotes">
        <li> She was well known for her lively and irreverent speaking style, as well as a rich treasury of early war stories. </li>
        <li> She also received the nickname "Grandma COBOL".</li>
        <li>For a long time we have called problems in machines or computers 'bugs'. </li>
        <li> In 1947 Grace and her associates discovered a moth inside the computer causing problems.</li> <li>This is held to be the first literal case of 'debugging' a computer to make it work.</li> 
        <li>The remains of the moth can be found in the Smithsonian Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.</li>
      </ul>
